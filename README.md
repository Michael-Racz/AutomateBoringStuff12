## 2048.py
This program will open a web browser in firefox and start playing the game 2048 with repeated keypresses: UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT. The game will not restart upon a game over. **For this program to work on your own you will need to use geckodriver for Firefox. Otherwise, you will not be able to open a window

### Uses
Selenium for the webdriver, selenium.webdriver.common.keys for the arrow key presses, and time for the program to slow down. It looks better when the presses are .1 seconds apart and not all instant.



Future plans with this project include:

-tracking different play styles to see which 'random' presses yield the highest scores.

-Being able to restart the game when there is a "Game Over"
